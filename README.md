My personal website, archiemckenzie.com. If you're wondering why I push to it so much, it's because I'm using it as a testing ground for [@generaltranslation/react](https://github.com/General-Translation/react-toolkit).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
